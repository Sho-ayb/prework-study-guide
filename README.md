# <Prework Study Project>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

The main aim of this project is to ensure that students are able to keep notes to reference back whilst partaking in the Trilogy Bootcamp for Front-End Web Development. As students go through the course, an individual webpage will provide a reference to thier own notes and also serve as part of learning Front-End Web Development.

Students would have learnt how to construct a HTML document and link a CSS stylee sheet and Javascript file to it.

This webpage also provides the student to check the developers console and see what to study next: from a select number of topics listed that involves the main topics in the Bootcamp course.
